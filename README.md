# QuickLit

QuickLit is a preemptive solution to a future problem this generation will face...
 There is, simply, a distinct lack of a dedicated medium for discussing books. 
 Such a simple idea as reading for entertainment has been forgotten in an age of technology for many young adults, 
 however soon the trend will come full circle for that exact reason - the simplicity of a good novel is its attraction.
 
 Described as the lovechild between Goodreads and Instagram, QuickLit will offer a social media platform for 
 the new generation of readers and non-readers alike. A devoted platform for sharing thoughts, reviews, or just your personality.

 QuickLit is a simple, sweet, and shareable social media dedicated to reviews, discussions, and profiles where you can show your 
 reading interests and habits.
